3. **Review**: Faculty/admin can see pending photos in dashboard
4. **Decision**: Admin approves or rejects each photo
5. **Display**: Only approved photos appear in public gallery

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Apache/Nginx web server
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Modern web browser

### Setup Steps
1. Place files in `student-corner/` directory
2. Ensure `public/gallery/` contains images
3. Set proper file permissions for photo uploads
4. Access via: `http://localhost/kamkus/student-corner/gallery.php`

### Demo Access
- **Student Login**: Use any username/password
- **Admin Access**: Login with username: `admin`, `faculty`, or `moderator`

## Database Integration (Future)

The current system uses localStorage for demo purposes. For production:

1. **Photos Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE gallery_photos (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       title VARCHAR(255),
       filename VARCHAR(255),
       student_name VARCHAR(100),
       upload_date DATE,
       status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected'),
       uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id)
   );
   ```

2. **Users Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
       password_hash VARCHAR(255),
       role ENUM('student', 'faculty', 'admin'),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

## Customization

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

### Production Recommendations
